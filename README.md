# Pokedex-Neptune-Navy
## Project Name

Pokemon Pokedex Neptune 

## Project Description

I am creating a Pokedex (Pokemon Index) which will allow the user to search for the first 150 Pokemon and get data that is specific for that Pokemon.  


## API and Data Sample

{
count: 964,
next: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset=150&limit=150",
previous: null,
results: [
{
name: "bulbasaur",
url: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/"
},
{

}
